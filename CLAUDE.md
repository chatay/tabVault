## Code Quality Principles

- Long-term solutions are always preferred over short-term workarounds. Do not patch around problems — fix the root cause.
- Writing good, maintainable code is crucial. Prioritize clarity, simplicity, and correctness over quick fixes.
- When facing a choice between a fast hack and a proper solution, choose the proper solution.
- Database-level enforcement is the source of truth — client-side checks are a UX convenience layer, not a security boundary.
